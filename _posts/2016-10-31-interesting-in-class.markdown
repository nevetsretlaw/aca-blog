My experience with [Austin Coding Academy](https://www.austincodingacademy.com/ "Austin Coding Academy") has been overwhelmingly positive to say the least. Our instructor, Rob, has done a great job fleshing out the concepts from our reading and relaying them in real terms.

One of the most interesting tricks that we learned in class was how to calculate the specificity of selectors. [Here](http://sixrevisions.com/css/css-specificity/) is a great website that explains the trick!
